## Controls:
- `W`/`S` to give thrust
- `Mouse Left/Right` to roll your ship
- `Mouse Up/Down` to pitch your ship
- `Alt`+`F4` to close the game (will add something better for this later)

## Why this name?
Because it's funny! It feels like a classic, old-style name, with the 3D and the X for eXtra cool-factor.
